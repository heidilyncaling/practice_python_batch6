# Get a string from the user  
# Create an empty new string to store the result  
# Go through each letter:  
# If it's uppercase, change it to lowercase (using ASCII values)  
# If it's already lowercase, just keep it the same  
# Add each processed letter to the new string  
# Return the final string with all lowercase letters
