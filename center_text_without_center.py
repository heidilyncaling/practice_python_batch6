# Get a string and a target length from the user  
# Find out how long the string currently is  
# If itâ€™s shorter than the target:  
# - Figure out how many spaces are needed  
# - Split them evenly for the left and right sides  
# - Add spaces on both sides to center it  
# If it's already long enough, return it as is
